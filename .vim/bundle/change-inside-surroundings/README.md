change-inside-surroundings.vim 
==============================

change-inside-surroundings.vim  provides a single command
`:ChangeInsideSurrounding` (also accessible via
`<leader>ci`) that will change the contents of the innermost 'surrounding'.

Examples
--------

Vim already provides fairly easy ways to change the 'surrounding' as long
as you specify the opening 'surrounding' character.  Vim also understands HTML
and XML tags, so you can change inside those as well.  I wanted a _single_
command that would intelligently just _do the right thing_.

**Normal Vim can do this:**

Change inside an HTML tag:

* Given: `<div>London Calling</div>`
* To replace the contents of the div tag I can use: `cit`

Change inside curly braces:

* Given: `{ death: "or glory!" }`
* To replace the contents of the curly braces I can use: `ci{`

Change inside brackets:

* Given: `[ Clampdown those Spanish Bombs ]`
* To replace the contents of the square brackets I can use: `ci[`

Change inside quotes:

* Given: `"The Guns of Brixton"`
* To replace the contents of the quotes I can use: <code>ci"</code>

**I wanted something simpler. This plugin provides a single command that works for all of these examples.**

Currently supported surroundings are: `{}`, `()`, `""`, `><`, `[]`, `''`, \`\`


Use
---

`:ChangeInsideSurrounding` or `<leader>ci` will remove the contents of the innermost 'surrounding', leaving you in insert mode.

`:ChangeAroundSurrounding` or `<leader>cas` will remove the entire text object, including the 'surrounding' characters, leaving you in insert mode.

# IndexedSearch.vim

Majorly rewritten by [Otto Modinos](https://github.com/otommod).

Originally by [Yakov Lerner](http://www.vim.org/account/profile.php?user_id=2342) and put on GitHub by [Henrik Nyh](https://github.com/henrik) to have it there in a [Pathogen](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2332)-friendly format.

[See the original plugin page at vim.org.](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1682)

```
This plugin redefines 6 search commands (/,?,n,N,*,#). At every 
search command, it automatically prints>
       "At match #N out of M matches". 
>
-- the total number of matches (M) and the number(index) of current 
match (N). This helps to get oriented when searching forward and 
backward. 

There are no new commands and no new behavior to learn. 
Just watch the bottom line when you do /,?,n,N,*,#. 
```

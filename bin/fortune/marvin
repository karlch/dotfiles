I think you ought to know I’m feeling very depressed.
%
It won’t work, I have an exceptionally large mind.
%
I am at a rough estimate thirty billion times more intelligent than you. Let me give you an example. Think of a number, any number.
Wrong. You see?
%
You are one of the least benightedly unintelligent life forms it has been my profound lack of pleasure not to be able to avoid meeting.
%
I have a million ideas. They all point to certain death.
%
Pardon me for breathing, which I never do anyway so I don’t know why I bother to say it, oh God, I’m so depressed. Here’s another one of those self-satisfied doors. Life! Don’t talk to me about life.
%
I could calculate your chance of survival, but you won’t like it.
%
My capacity for happiness, you could fit into a matchbox without taking out the matches first
%
Funny, how just when you think life can’t possibly get any worse it suddenly does.
%
The first ten million years were the worst. And the second ten million they were the worst, too. The third ten million I didn’t enjoy at all. After that, I went into a bit of a decline.
%
I’d give you advice, but you wouldn’t listen. No one ever does.
%
I’m just trying to die.
%
I’ve seen it. It’s rubbish.
%
Here I am, brain the size of a planet and you ask me to do something as profound as this. Call that job satisfaction? ‘Cos I don’t.
%
I think you ought to know I’m feeling very depressed.
%
I’m not getting you down at all am I?
%
Now the world has gone to bed
Darkness won’t engulf my head
I can see by infra-red
How I hate the night
Now I lay me down to sleep
Try to count electric sheep
Sweet dream wishes you can keep
How I hate the night”
%
Do you want me to sit in a corner and rust, or just fall apart where I’m standing?
%
It’s the people you meet in this job that really get you down.
%
Hardly worth anyone’s while to help a menial robot, is it ?… I mean, where’s the percentage in being kind or helpful to a robot if it doesn’t have any gratitude circuits?
%
I only have to talk to somebody and they begin to hate me. Even robots hate me. If you just ignore me I expect I shall probably go away.
%
This is the sort of thing you lifeforms enjoy, is it?
%
Incredible… it’s even worse than I thought it would be.
%
Don’t pretend you want to talk to me, I know you hate me.
%
The best conversation I had was over forty million years ago…. And that was with a coffee machine.
%
Why should I want to make anything up? Life’s bad enough as it is without wanting to invent any more of it.
%
Wearily I sit here, pain and misery my only companions. Why stop now just when I’m hating it?
%
Well I wish you’d just tell me rather than try to engage my enthusiasm.
%
It gives me a headache just trying to think down to your level.
%
I won’t enjoy it.
%
Sounds awful.

## My dotfiles

This setup is on all of my arch and arch-based systems. I use i3-gaps with
i3blocks, compton, zsh, tmux and nvim. Most of the configs are commented rather
well and should be easy to adapt. If you still have questions, feel free to open
an issue.

The dotfiles are managed with GNU stow. Typically all files grouped in one of
the directories (e.g vim) reside in $HOME. To quickly initialize all dotfiles
you can use the `init.sh` script.

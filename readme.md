## My dotfiles

This setup is on all of my arch and arch-based systems. I use i3 with i3blocks,
conky, zsh, tmux and nvim. Most of the configs are commented rather well and
should be easy to adapt. If you still have questions, feel free to open an
issue.

The dotfiles are managed with GNU stow. Typically all files grouped in one of
the directories (e.g vim) reside in $HOME.

The Wallpaper is uploaded to the gh-pages branch. It is modified from the
original which you can find here: http://i.imgur.com/feVRCIO.png
